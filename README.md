A Twitter bot that automatically generates and posts tweets about the GiveRep project on the Sui network using AI.

## Features

- Automatic tweet generation using AI (DeepSeek, OpenAI, or AIML)
- Support for multiple Twitter accounts
- Scheduled automatic posting
- Failed tweet storage and retry capability
- Multilingual tweet generation
- Performance analysis and reporting
- Smart templates based on previous performance

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 14 or higher
- Twitter account(s) with API credentials
- AI API keys (optional, has fallback mechanisms)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-auto-poster-bot-ai.git
cd twitter-auto-poster-bot-ai
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure your Twitter accounts:
   - Create an `accounts.txt` file in the root directory
   - Add Twitter API credentials in the format: `APP_KEY,APP_SECRET,ACCESS_TOKEN,ACCESS_SECRET`
   - Each line represents one account
   - Lines starting with # are treated as comments

4. Configure AI API keys:
   - Create a `config.json` file or set environment variables
   - Set either DeepSeek, OpenAI, or AIML API keys

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can use the following environment variables:
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`: Your DeepSeek API key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `AIML_API_KEY`: Your AIML API key

### Config File

The bot will automatically create a default `config.json` if it doesn't exist. You can edit this file to include your API keys:

```json
{
  "deepseekApiKey": "your-deepseek-api-key",
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key",
  "aimlApiKey": "your-aiml-api-key",
  "twitterConfig": {
    "postInterval": 24,
    "retryDelay": 300,
    "maxRetries": 1
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Run

To run the bot once:

```bash
npm start
```

### Scheduled Mode

To run the bot on a schedule:

```bash
# Run every 24 hours (default)
npm run schedule

# Run every 6 hours
node index.js --schedule --interval=6
```

### Using GitHub Actions for Automation

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs the bot every 3 hours. To use it:

1. Push this repository to GitHub
2. Go to your repository's Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions
3. Add the following secrets:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
   - `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`: Your DeepSeek API key
   - Any other API keys needed for your configuration
4. The workflow will automatically start running based on the schedule (every 3 hours)
5. You can also manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab in your repository

To modify the schedule, edit the `.github/workflows/tweet-scheduler.yml` file and change the cron expression.

### Diagnostics

To check your configuration without posting:

```bash
npm run diagnostics
```

### Retry Failed Tweets

To retry previously failed tweets:

```bash
npm run retry
```

### Performance Analysis

To analyze tweet performance:

```bash
npm run analyze
```

## Troubleshooting

### Twitter Rate Limiting

If you encounter rate limiting:
1. Increase the interval between posts
2. Add more Twitter accounts
3. Use the retry functionality later

### API Key Issues

If you have issues with AI API keys:
1. The bot includes fallback mechanisms with predefined texts
2. Try using a different AI service (DeepSeek, OpenAI, or AIML)
3. Check that your API keys are correctly formatted
